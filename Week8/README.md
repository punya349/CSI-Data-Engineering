🚕 Week 8 – NYC Yellow Taxi Data Analytics using PySpark
This project is based on analyzing real-world taxi trip data from NYC using PySpark inside a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to load, transform, and extract insights from the dataset through DataFrame-based operations.

📓 Notebook
📁 Dataset Information
Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission - Kaggle
Filename: yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv
Size: ~295 MB+
Includes columns for fare details, trip times, pickup/drop locations, tips, surcharges, etc.
📌 You can also find original data from the official TLC site

⚙️ Tools & Tech Used
Python
PySpark (Apache Spark 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook
Parquet format for storage optimization
🔄 Workflow Steps
Loaded the .csv file into a Spark DataFrame
Cleaned and preprocessed the data:
Converted string timestamps to proper datetime format
Casted relevant fields to numeric types
Wrote the cleaned data as a Parquet file to optimize querying
Ran a series of analytical queries on the processed data
🔍 Analytical Queries Performed
Query	Summary
Q1	Created a Revenue column by summing up 'Fare_amount', 'Extra', 'MTA_tax', 'Improvement_surcharge', 'Tip_amount', 'Tolls_amount', and 'Total_amount'
Q2	Counted total passengers grouped by pickup location area
Q3	Calculated average fare and total earnings for both vendors
Q4	Computed a rolling count of payments for each payment type
Q5	Identified the top 2 highest earning vendors on a specific day, showing total distance and passenger count
Q6	Found the most traveled route based on maximum passenger count between pickup and dropoff
Q7	Fetched top pickup locations with the most passengers in the last simulated 5–10 seconds
